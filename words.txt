Overall

Minimal approach that lets the products speak for themselves. 

Splash

You'll be able to collate arbitrary lists of products (sales, seasonal collections) and feature them here, or choose from any existing content on the site – brands, product categories, individual products, journal entries. Eight links to content are displayed simultaneously with equal importance, so you don't have to agonize over a single image being perfect. These links provide a range of starting points and inspirations for curious customers.

The image currently under the cursor expands, which gives us the best of both worlds – individual images can be shown large, clear and impactful, and the collection of images gives a well-rounded overview of Kinoko's ethos and style. Customers can browse through featured items in a smooth, click-free way.

Clicking on the Kinoko logo or scrolling down dismisses the splash screen and brings you directly to Products. The site's menu is accessible for those looking for something specific.

Products

This template, with minor variations, is used to display any collection of products: categories, brands, sales, seasonal lists.

Reflecting the style of your product photography, we've endeavoured to keep this page ruthlessly light and functional, with a bare minimum of text. Product imagery fills the majority of the screen in a utalitarian grid. Product names and prices are only visible on hover. This allows an uncluttered, distraction-free browsing where the products themselves do the talking.

To the left, a sidebar provides rapid navigation between brands and categories without leaving the grid view. Depending on the number of products displayed, the grid varies automatically between 3 and 5 columns.

Optionally, a written introduction may appear at the top of the page to provide information about a brand or curated list.

The products around the mouse cursor enlarge subtly in a reference to the homepage.




    Brand / Category
    
    Single
    
    When viewing a single product, images are displayed at a generously huge and detailed size, using the same mechanic as the homepage to slide between them. Written product information and buy buttons are displayed at the left; moving the cursor to this section expands it, revealing more in-depth information about the brand. Clicking an image expands it to a full-screen zoomed view, where all the fine details of the product can be appreciated.


Menu

The menu is comprehensive, providing links to every page, brand or category on the site. The menu also houses a mini-shopping cart, allowing customers to quickly and easily view or edit the contents of their cart as they shop instead of interrupting them to go to a specific cart page. The menu button itself displays the number of items in the cart (if any).

Typeface 

    For the typographic system of the site we have chosen a pairing of two variations of Atlas from Commercial Type; Grotesk and Typewriter. Throughout the site we alternate between the two, for information about a product we use Grotesk for its simple and to the point functionality. For the narrative and backstory of a product, we switch to Typewriter. This is carried over to the journal entries that tell more of the story.e
